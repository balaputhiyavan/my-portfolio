## Overview
**SkyForm** is a native iOS application engineered for reliability and scalability. It serves as a comprehensive tool for collecting survey data in the field. By adopting the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, the codebase is testable, modular, and easy to maintain. It showcases advanced usage of **SwiftUI** for declarative UI and an **SQL database** (SQLite) for complex object graph persistence and local data management.
